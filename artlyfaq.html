                FAQ <br/><br/>

                How do I return or exchange an item?
                <br/><br/>
                To initiate a return, please submit a request for a Return Authorization (RA) through your SSENSE account. Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care team to assist you with the return process. SSENSE adheres to a strict no-paper policy, so as to reduce waste. This is why shipments do not include a return slip inside the box.
                <br/><br/>
                SSENSE does not process direct exchanges. We ask that you return the merchandise for a full refund and place a new order for the preferred item(s) at your earliest convenience. Returns are subject to our Return Policy.
                <br/><br/>
                Guest Orders: If an order was placed using the guest check out option, please create an SSENSE account to request and manage the return yourself. Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care team to help facilitate the return.
                <br/><br/>
                Can I cancel or modify my order?
                <br/><br/>
                Modifying or cancelling an order is possible so long as the merchandise has not yet entered the packaging or shipment phases.
                <br/><br/>
                If you have an SSENSE account, to modify or cancel your order:
                <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Log in to your SSENSE account</li>
                    <li>Click on the Order History tab on the left-hand side</li>
                    <li>Under Modify, select the subject of your request</li>
                    <li>Fill out the contact form and send us your request</li>

                </ul>
                Please contact our Customer Care team if you do not have an SSENSE account and would like to make changes to an existing order. Our 24/7 Customer Care team will help facilitate any changes before the order enters the shipping queue.
                <br/><br/>
                Please note: if an order was placed using the guest check out option, you must create an SSENSE account to modify the order yourself. If you do not wish to create an SSENSE account, you can always contact our Customer Care team for assistance in modifying the order.
                <br/><br/>
                When will I receive my order?
                <br/><br/>
                Once your purchase has been completed, an e-mail confirmation will be sent to the email address that we have on file for you. This e-mail acts as an invoice and includes your order number.
                <br/><br/>
                Once your order is placed, a standard processing time of up to 2 business days is required before the order is shipped out. Orders placed after 11:00 AM (EST) may be processed the next business day, and orders placed on weekends and holidays will be processed the following business day starting at 8:00 AM (EST). During peak periods, processing times may exceed 2 business days.
                <br/><br/>
                Once your order has been shipped, you will receive an e-mail with your shipment’s tracking information, allowing you to keep tabs on the progress of your delivery.
                <br/><br/>
                How do I know the item will fit me? OR How does the item fit?
                <br/><br/>
                In order to help find the best fit, the following information is available on every product page:
                <br/>

                <ul>
                    <li>A size conversion chart to help convert international sizes.</li>
                    <li>Product-specific measurements (i.e., sleeve length, pant leg width etc.).</li>
                    <li>Size of the garment worn by the model, alongside their specific measurements.</li>
                    <li>Fill out the contact form and send us your request</li>

                </ul>
                The above can be found in the ‘View Size Chart’ tab on any item’s product page.
                <br/><br/>
                Our Customer Care team is always available to answer any questions regarding measurements and fitting.
                <br/><br/>
                Are duties and taxes included?
                <br/><br/>
                Taxes
                <br/><br/>
                The prices listed on individual product pages are calculated based on the location you are shopping from. In order to ensure you’re seeing the most accurate pricing, taxes and delivery fees while you browse, make sure to select your shipping country at the bottom of any page.
                <br/><br/>
                Please note: when using the SSENSE mobile app please allow access to location services in order to see location specific pricing.
                <br/><br/>
                Canada
                <br/><br/>
                For orders that are placed within Canada, customers will be charged federal and provincial sales taxes -- these depend on which province the order is being shipped to. Since SSENSE is a Montreal-based company, Canadian orders will not be subjected to any duties upon delivery, as the shipment is not traversing any borders.
                <br/><br/>
                International
                <br/><br/>
                We ship to over 40 countries with duties and taxes included. If applicable, duties and taxes will be included in the final price at check out and your order will be shipped DDP (Delivered Duty Paid). Upon delivery, you will not be required to pay any additional fees.
                <br/><br/>
                If duties and taxes are not included in the final price at check out, your order will be shipped DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid). As such, your order may incur duties, fees and import taxes upon delivery. This charge is determined by your local customs authority and payment of these fees is obligatory if you wish to obtain your shipment. For further information, please consult your local customs office.
                <br/><br/>
                United States
                <br/><br/>
                By placing an order with us, you acknowledge that this sale occurs outside the United States, and that you are importing your order for non-commercial (personal) use. You also acknowledge that you will be listed as the importer for US Customs and Border Protection purposes and that your order will be imported into the United States in accordance with the necessary customs requirements.
                <br/><br/>
                To simplify this process, your order indicates your agreement to authorize SSENSE to appoint a designated carrier/customs broker, where applicable, as your unpaid agent for customs purposes by executing a power of attorney applicable to a single non-commercial shipment. Your order serves as an electronic signature indicating your agreement to the following, as required by US Customs and Border Protection:
                <br/><br/>
                “The designated carrier/customs broker is hereby authorized to execute, as an unpaid agent who has knowledge of the facts, pursuant to the provisions of section 485(f), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the consignee’s and owner’s declarations provided for in section 485 (a) and (d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and to enter on my behalf or for my account the goods described in the attached invoice which contains a true and complete statement of the facts concerning the shipment.”
                <br/><br/>
                Your authorization permits the carrier/customs broker to file on your behalf: (i) an administrative entry under section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930, if eligible (see below); (ii) an informal entry pursuant to section 143.21 of the Customs Regulations, if eligible; or (iii)the formal entry  for any order that is over $2,500, or otherwise requires formal entry. 
                <br/><br/>
                You are responsible for any U.S. duties, taxes and fees that may be due under U.S. law. Shipments to the U.S. of goods that are valued at US$800 or less may be imported without the payment of duties and taxes subject to certain restrictions, pursuant to section 321 of the U.S. Tariff Act of 1930 (“Section 321”). These restrictions include the following:
                <br/><br/>
                <ol>
                    <li>A single contract or order addressed to a same individual that exceeds US$800, cannot be split into more than one shipment to avoid the payment of duties and taxes;</li>
                    <li>Individual orders addressed to a same individual that are consolidated by the shipper or carrier on a single bill of lading (“B/L”) or air waybill (“AWB”) will be treated as a single shipment and will not be entitled to Section 321 treatment if the total value exceeds US$800; and</li>
                    <li>If there are individual B/Ls or AWBs, the shipment will qualify unless there are several B/Ls or AWBs addressed to same individual with shipment on the same day and the total value of these shipments is over US$800, in which case U.S. Customs and Border Protection will treat them as a single shipment.</li>
                </ol>
                It is SSENSE's position that all goods purchased from us, should be imported into the United States without the payment of duties and taxes pursuant to section 321, only when section 321 is applicable. Our express carriers have been instructed  to only apply Section 321 where applicable.
