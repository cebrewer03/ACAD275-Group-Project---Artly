      Artly is a creative hub for young artists at USC. This web page will allow artists to display their still art and expand their platform. Each week the curators will review the submissions and display a certain number of artists in various categories such as GRAPHIC, PAINT, EXPERIMENTAL, TYPE, etc. Along with their bio, the artistsâ€™ contact information will be featured so that site visitors can connect with the artists. Artly is not a social media platform but rather a virtual showroom. Through this unmediated virtual space, USC artists can find artists to collaborate and grow with.
