        Artly is a virtual showroom for USC-based artists who are looking to collaborate with fellow students. Artly is at the ground floor of burgeoning creativity. We are here to center and elevate the still art of USCâ€™s innovative student body. 

      Target site visitors would first be other student artists looking to connect with USC artists. Any appreciator of student art is also targeted, both those who are familiar and unfamiliar with the technicalities of the artistic practice.
