# ACAD275-Group-Project---Artly
Alvaro Camaro, Jade Franson, and Camryn Brewer on ARTLY

NOTE TO PROFESSOR PLEASE READ! 
- we know that the navigation bumps down and overlaps once the browser size hits around 1200px, but as a part of our adaptive layout we will have a hamburger menu that appears at this breakpoint that when clicked will slide down the about, graphic design, photography, submit art, FAQ, and discover navigation buttons. Essentially the original navigation will disappear and be condensed into this hamburger navigation if that makes sense. We are still in the process of ironing out this feature, but you can see the starts of it in the html for the graphic design page. 

Thoughts: 
1. all the text should be visible on the landing page without scrolling, the paragraph is a bit cut off
2. should the user be able to click on the individual artworks or just the artist page (basically asking if this is about looking at student work or connecting with artists)

NEXT STEPS:
1. adding a connect button that gives them the artist's email/phone number
2. adding scripting
3. adding artist pages
