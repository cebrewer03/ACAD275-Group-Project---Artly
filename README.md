# ACAD275-Group-Project---Artly
Alvaro Camaro, Jade Franson, and Camryn Brewer on ARTLY


Thoughts: 
1. all the text should be visible on the landing page without scrolling, the paragraph is a bit cut off
2. should the user be able to click on the individual artworks or just the artist page (basically asking if this is about looking at student work or connecting with artists)

NEXT STEPS:
1. adding a connect button that gives them the artist's email/phone number
2. adding scripting
3. adding artist pages
